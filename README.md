Introduction
This app is designed to help groups of friends track their expenses and make sure that everyone pays their fair share. The app allows users to create an account, add their friends to the group, create a trip, add expenses to the trip, tag the group members who are responsible for each expense, upload receipts for the expenses, split the expenses evenly among the group members, and close the group once all expenses are split evenly.
